Desktop styling issues:

refer to "./explore/assets/desktop" for images

600px wide body "container",
make it click-through-able

pull-out menu - attach to main window,
set fixed width, 300px looks good

settings pages should pull down from top, bring in semi-opaque overlay underneath - z-index solves this

Maybe input doesn't move to top of screen?

bottom area needs fixed height

All in all, not as much as I thought!


NICE TO HAVES:

make topbar menu to replace hamburger
